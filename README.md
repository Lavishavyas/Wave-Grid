### Interactive Wave Grid ✨

This is a dynamic, front-end web application that showcases a responsive grid of squares with a mesmerizing, bouncing wave effect. The project was built using **React.js** to meet the requirements of a full-stack developer assignment. 💻



### Key Features and Functionality 🚀

* **Dynamic Grid:** The application renders a grid of squares whose dimensions automatically adjust to the size of the user's browser window, ensuring a seamless experience on any device. 🖥️📏
* **Bouncing Wave Pattern:** A visually engaging wave pattern moves horizontally across the grid, smoothly bouncing off the left and right edges. 🌊🪃
* **Timed Color Transitions:** The wave's color changes in a timed, sequential manner. It holds a single color (e.g., green) for a set duration before slowly and smoothly transitioning into the next color (e.g., blue), creating a vibrant, fluid glow. 🎨⏳🌈
* **Modular Design:** The project is built with modular, reusable components, specifically a `<Grid>` component that encapsulates all the core logic for the wave and color effects. 🏗️🧩
* **Game-like UI:** The user interface features a dark theme with glowing elements and subtle transitions, giving the application a creative and modern "game feel." 🎮🌃

The project successfully demonstrates strong foundational skills in front-end development, including **React state management** ⚛️, **dynamic UI rendering**, **responsive design**, and **CSS-in-JS styling** to create a compelling and interactive user experience. 👍

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
