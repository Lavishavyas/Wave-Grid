# Wave-Grid
✨ Interactive Wave Grid ✨  A dynamic React.js application featuring a responsive grid with a bouncing wave. The wave's color transitions smoothly over a set time, cycling through a vibrant palette (green, blue, purple). The grid automatically adjusts to any screen size, all presented within a clean, game-like UI. 🎮💻🌊🎨
