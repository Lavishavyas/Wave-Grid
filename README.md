### Key Features and Functionality 🚀

* **Dynamic Grid:** The application renders a grid of squares whose dimensions automatically adjust to the size of the user's browser window, ensuring a seamless experience on any device. 🖥️📏
* **Bouncing Wave Pattern:** A visually engaging wave pattern moves horizontally across the grid, smoothly bouncing off the left and right edges. 🌊🪃
* **Timed Color Transitions:** The wave's color changes in a timed, sequential manner. It holds a single color (e.g., green) for a set duration before slowly and smoothly transitioning into the next color (e.g., blue), creating a vibrant, fluid glow. 🎨⏳🌈
* **Modular Design:** The project is built with modular, reusable components, specifically a `<Grid>` component that encapsulates all the core logic for the wave and color effects. 🏗️🧩
* **Game-like UI:** The user interface features a dark theme with glowing elements and subtle transitions, giving the application a creative and modern "game feel." 🎮🌃

The project successfully demonstrates strong foundational skills in front-end development, including **React state management** ⚛️, **dynamic UI rendering**, **responsive design**, and **CSS-in-JS styling** to create a compelling and interactive user experience. 👍
